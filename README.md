# Streamlit-PoliceStopandSearch-UK

Using the streamlit library to provide an interface for querying UK Police stop and search data

A write up on my blog is available [here]

Application uses Python, with Streamlit, Pandas, Requests, Datetime, Altair and pydeck and the [UK Police Data API](https://data.police.uk/docs/)

## How does it work

Using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) makes it easier to build something usable in a few minutes.

Streamlit provides the layout, text inputs, buttons and wraps around the core functions of the lookup.
