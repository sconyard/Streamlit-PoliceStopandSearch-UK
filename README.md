# Streamlit-PoliceStopandSearch-UK

Using the streamlit library to provide an interface for querying UK Police stop and search data

A write up on my blog is available [here](https://virtual-simon.co.uk/police-api-stop-and-search-lookup-with-streamlit/)

Application uses Python, with Streamlit, Pandas, Requests, Datetime, Altair and pydeck and the [UK Police Data API](https://data.police.uk/docs/)

## How does it work

Using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) makes it easier to build something usable in a few minutes.

Streamlit provides the layout, text inputs, buttons and wraps around the core functions of the lookup.

![First Launch](https://github.com/sconyard/Streamlit-PoliceStopandSearch-UK/blob/f13f3949658da1d4b55115bc441a3e2fcd1d3bc3/images/Firstrun.png)

The API lookup is initiated by clicking the button, and a static call is presented to make sure some data is populated into the site on first run, it could target any time and force, but it is querying Avon & Somerset in January 2020.

![Selection](https://github.com/sconyard/Streamlit-PoliceStopandSearch-UK/blob/86fa2d9f7208f63fe455c0e71c6bd08181049ad3/images/Selection.png)

On first run the tool is actually passing two API lookups, one to complete the data request for Avon and Somerset, the other to pull back a list of available forces to query via the [Forces](https://data.police.uk/docs/method/forces/) API call.  Unique values returned from this query are being used to populate the dropdown box displayed in the UI. 

The date input is using [streamlit.date_input](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/widgets/st.date_input), this returns a value in yyyy-mm-dd format, the API is expecting yyyy-mm so the returned value is passed through strftime, to generate the correct formate for the API query (date = date.strftime("%Y-%m"))

Both values are stored in a streamlit session state, which is used for any subsequent query lookups, allowing the force and date the API returns data for to be changed very simply via the UI.

![Map](https://github.com/sconyard/Streamlit-PoliceStopandSearch-UK/blob/86fa2d9f7208f63fe455c0e71c6bd08181049ad3/images/Map.png)

The API query returns records of stops along with locations in the format of lattitude and longditude coordinates, information that can be plotted on a map. Streamlit includes integrations to [pydeck_chart](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/charts/st.pydeck_chart) which is used to plot the stop and search information to the map.

Rather than referencing the existing dataframe created from the API query, the script builds a smaller table containing only the lan/lon pairs.  Building the new table makes it easier to perform some error checking, to only pull in numeric values and to drop any na values that pydeck_chart will not easily process.

The initial map view is centred on the south of the UK, not where the data is presented, so some geography knowledge is required to navigate the generated map to the force location.

![Table](https://github.com/sconyard/Streamlit-PoliceStopandSearch-UK/blob/86fa2d9f7208f63fe455c0e71c6bd08181049ad3/images/Table.png)

A table containing the data returned from the API query is then presented back, including an option to download the table in a CSV format.

![Graph](https://github.com/sconyard/Streamlit-PoliceStopandSearch-UK/blob/86fa2d9f7208f63fe455c0e71c6bd08181049ad3/images/Graph.png)

The data can be presented and graphed in many interesting ways, within this MVP a graph is presented to highlight the age of the person being stopped against the object of search

![Error](https://github.com/sconyard/Streamlit-PoliceStopandSearch-UK/blob/86fa2d9f7208f63fe455c0e71c6bd08181049ad3/images/Error.png)

Error handling is provided for circumstances where no data is returned by the query.  Ordinarily errors are thrown only if the API call returns no data.  No data present either means the date is out of range, or the force in scope has not uploaded data to be queried for the selected timeframe.
